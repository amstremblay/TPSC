<h1 align="center">TPSC</h1>
<p align="center">
A Python library that allows the computation of Hubbard model related functions and quantities (such as the self-energy and Green's function) using the Two-Particle-Self-Consistent (TPSC) approach first described in
[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9702188">Vilk and Tremblay, 1997</a>]. See additional references in the documentation.

## Installation

This package will be soon available on PyPI. 
Meanwhile, you can install it by cloning this repository and using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amstremblay/TPSC
cd TPSC
pip install .
```

## Documentation and tutorials

Documentation sources are located in the ``docs`` folder.
To build the documentation locally:

```bash
pip install .[docs]
cd docs
make html
```

You can access the documentation in your browser by opening ``docs/build/html/index.html``.


## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains some examples for you to experiment with and get familiar with different use cases.

The quickest way to start doing calculations using TPSC is to call the `TPSC` executable from the command line and provide input parameters in a JSON `para.json` file (see the `examples` directory):

```bash
TPSC para.json
```

TPSC could also be use in Python scripts for a finner control over input parameters or to post-process the results of TPSC calculations such as plotting observables.

## Tests

The ``tests`` folder provides automated tests that can be run to ensure TPSC is behaving correctly on your system.
To run the tests:

```bash
pip install .[tests]
cd tests
pytest
```

Every test should pass.
If not, please create an issue with the output of the above code and a description of your system.

## TODO

* Release on PyPi
* Fail to install when there is an venv named env2
* Automated tests with `pytest`
* Automated documentation release on GitHub
* More examples
* Inclure TPSC+ ?
* Inclure binding avec TRIQS ?
