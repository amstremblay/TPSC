TPSC is a Python library that allows the computation of Hubbard model related functions and quantities (such as the self-energy and Green's function) using the Two-Particle-Self-Consistent (TPSC) approach first described in `[Vilk and Tremblay, 1997] <https://jp1.journaldephysique.org/articles/jp1/abs/1997/11/jp1v7p1309/jp1v7p1309.html>`_.

TPSC is developped at the Institut Quantique of Sherbrooke University (Quebec, Canada) by students of André-Marie Tremblay group.
It aims to provide a ready-to-use implementation of the TPSC method and some functions to post-process the results of the calculation.
